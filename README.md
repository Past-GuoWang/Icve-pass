# Zhihuishu Automated Learning Script

## Overview

This repository contains a script designed to facilitate automated learning on the **Zhihuishu (Wisdom Tree)** platform. The script leverages the **Selenium** framework and the **requests** library to simulate human interactions, ensuring a seamless and efficient learning experience.

We welcome contributions from experienced developers to help optimize the code, which currently employs procedural programming practices and infinite loops. Your feedback on potential improvements is highly valued, and we encourage collaborative learning and development.
